        <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> Any transactions or interactions involving the Twench token are processed on the Solana blockchain. This enables transparency and decentralization but also makes transaction data publicly available and immutable.</li>

These providers only access your information as necessary to perform their tasks and are obligated to maintain its confidentiality.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and Compliance Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes, protect the rights of our users, or ensure the safety and integrity of our Game.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Blockchain Data:</strong> Any transaction made on the Solana blockchain, including transactions related to TwenchRun, is recorded publicly and accessible to anyone. This data cannot be altered or deleted due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.</li>
